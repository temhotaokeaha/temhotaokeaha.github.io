        <h3>Screenshots</h3>
        <p>
	    In the last year or two, while (re)playing few games, I made some screenshots of different locations. There's both nostalgic and aesthetical value in it, for me at least, and these screenshots can serve if not as a motivation to pick up the title in question, then at least as a slice of what the game is artistically. <br>
        <br>
        Most screenshots were made without HUD and they are typically 1920x1080, so they should work well as wallpapers. <br>
		<br>
		There's only HL1 as of now, I will add screenshots of several "Call of Duty: Black Ops" zombie maps later. There will be .zip archives with additional screenshots aswell.
